## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates the potential outcome of the **UEFA Women’s Euro 2025 Final** between **Spain** and **England**, using real team statistics and statistical modeling.

Using **Poisson regression**, team-specific offensive and defensive metrics were modeled to simulate goal scoring. The match was then run through **10,000 Monte Carlo simulations** to predict:
- Most likely scorelines
- Win probabilities after 90 minutes
- Extra time and penalty outcomes

---

## 🎯 Business Task
**Objective**: Help stakeholders (teams, analysts, fans) understand the most probable outcomes of the final using historical performance data and statistical modeling.

## 📊 Key Results

| Metric | Spain | England |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Total Win Probability | **60.03%** | 39.97% |
| 90-Minute Win % | 50.62% | 32.49% |
| Extra Time Win % | 6.68% | 4.92% |
| Penalty Shootout Win % | 2.73% | 2.56% |

- Most frequent scoreline: **Spain 3 - England 2**
- Simulation ran for **10,000 matches** using team attacking/defensive metrics

## ⚙️ Methods Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib)
- Poisson Regression for goal modeling
- Monte Carlo Simulation (10,000 runs)
- Tableau for final visualization
